When a value of 0 is entered, a prompt is displayed which mentions a debug error and that an abort has been called.  In the command execution window, it says that an assertion failed and gives the condition and line number of that assertion.  
cout always gives zero because value was initialized as a integerm, it does not store any decimal values and any operations done with that integer (if only integers are involved) are also treated as integers.  If value was initialized as a double, then it could store values beyond the decimal point. 
// A memory leak is when memory is not returned by the program to the operating system for use by other programs.  A dangling pointer is a pointer that is referencing an address in memory that has been returned to the operating system.  It is no longer a valid address that the pointer points to.  
This is amemory leak.
This line tells the program to go to the spot that ptr references and output that value.  The problem is that the pointer does not refer to a valid location and in accessing that location generates a warning that states this access violation.
This is once again a dangling pointer.  It is not an issue of memory not being returned to the operating system, but that the pointer is referencing a location that is no longer valid.
